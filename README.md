Inside thesrc folder there are two files both named QuickSort and both implement the quick sort algorithim, the difference is one is written in C and the other is written in Assembly both code files work. Inside both pieces of code the partition function is the hotspot and the execution of the hotspot are both timed in milliseconds.

How to use:

QuickSort.asm: using an asembly compiler the file can be executed and it would return the sorted array with the execution time of the hotspot

QuickSort.c: the file can be executed using this command in terminal: gcc QuickSort.c and it would return the sorted array with the execution time of the hotspot

The objective of this project is to compare how fast both assembly and C code can implament the partition function in the quicksort algorithm.
